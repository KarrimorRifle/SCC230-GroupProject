# Requirements

## App mission

Allowing non-developers to interact with internet-of-things (IOT) items through a high-level code-blocks interface, similar to scratch.

## Bringing requirements into github

### Milestones:

**Milestone** will include set **FR**s and their **NFR**s

Currently planned Milestones:

1. Allowing users to place code-blocks
2. Having the code-blocks interact with a micro-controller, allowing for output
3. Recieve inputs from a micro-controller's connected sensors
4. Allowing users to create and log in to accounts
5. Allowing users to save routines
6. **to be decided...**

### Issues

An issue for each requirements (**FRs & NFRs**)
